# Data Folder

This folder contains three `.zip` files:

- `fingerprints.zip`, a collection of the fingerprints collected from the target devices that were used in simulating
  the reinforcement learning (RL) environment.
- `additional_benign_behavior_fingerprints.zip`, the collection of fingerprints which were collected while executing
  additional benign behaviors on the victim devices.
- `plots_and_results.zip`, a collection of all accuracy computations, metrics/results, and plots that were used
  throughout the evaluations addressed in the report.
